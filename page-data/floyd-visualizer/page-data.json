This endeavor was not just about fulfilling academic requirements; it was a pursuit to blend theory with practical application and create a learning tool that goes beyond traditional methods.\n\n## The Inspiration\nThe project was inspired by a desire to see theoretical concepts come to life. Collaborating with a team that brought diverse skills and backgrounds, I found myself in a unique position to lead and innovate, despite some team members not being familiar with all the technologies involved. It was an opportunity to showcase my leadership and technical skills in a real-world setting.\n\n## Challenges and Triumphs\nThroughout this project, I navigated challenges such as handling large data sets, optimizing application performance, and integrating external services. One of the most significant accomplishments was designing a user-friendly interface for an inherently complex application. Each challenge was a learning opportunity, pushing me to apply my knowledge and skills in novel ways.\n\n## Core Features of the Application\n\nInteractive graph visualization and manipulation with Cytoscape.js.\nImplementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest path finding.\nSolving and visualizing the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).\nCapability to dynamically modify graphs (adding/removing nodes and edges).\nIntegration with external APIs for practical data application.\nSupport for importing and exporting graph data in JSON format.\nDevelopment of an intuitive interface for complex algorithm interactions.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Floyd Warshall Screens\n\n![Floyd Warshall Screen 1](feature.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n![Floyd Warshall Screen 2](FloydScreen2.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n![Floyd Warshall Screen 3](FloydScreen3.png)\n<br/>\n\n\n### Travelling Salesman Problem Screens\n\n\n![TSP Screen](TSPScreen.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n![TSP Screen 2](TSPScreen2.png)\n<br/>\n\n\n![TSP Screen 3](TSPScreen3.png)\n\n\n## Video Demo\n\n### Floyd Warshall Application\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xnEv2_aoAqU?si=g3hTxW2J0JSp-Qx_\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n        allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\n### Travelling Salesman Problem Application\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQGZJXiWaKc?si=3cCgVkADCIIp4j-i\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n        allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\n","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#introduction","title":"Introduction"},{"url":"#the-inspiration","title":"The Inspiration"},{"url":"#challenges-and-triumphs","title":"Challenges and Triumphs"},{"url":"#core-features-of-the-application","title":"Core Features of the Application"},{"url":"#screenshots","title":"Screenshots","items":[{"url":"#floyd-warshall-screens","title":"Floyd Warshall Screens"},{"url":"#travelling-salesman-problem-screens","title":"Travelling Salesman Problem Screens"}]},{"url":"#video-demo","title":"Video Demo","items":[{"url":"#floyd-warshall-application","title":"Floyd Warshall Application"},{"url":"#travelling-salesman-problem-application","title":"Travelling Salesman Problem Application"}]}]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"algorithm-analyzer","title":"Interactive Python GUI for Visualizing Sorting Algorithms","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/499b4/feature.jpg","srcSet":"/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/0389d/feature.jpg 13w,\n/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/93657/feature.jpg 25w,\n/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/499b4/feature.jpg 50w,\n/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/a1b81/feature.jpg 100w","sizes":"(min-width: 50px) 50px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/17955/feature.webp 13w,\n/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/55a61/feature.webp 25w,\n/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/b90ba/feature.webp 50w,\n/static/46dd54ee74947ec6b36012ae6dcc676d/3d77e/feature.webp 100w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 50px) 50px, 100vw"}]},"width":50,"height":40}}}}},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"mylocaltask","title":"Kanban Task Manager - Angular 17","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/57a8c/feature.png","srcSet":"/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/0d135/feature.png 13w,\n/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/ed1b0/feature.png 25w,\n/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/57a8c/feature.png 50w,\n/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/0590c/feature.png 100w","sizes":"(min-width: 50px) 50px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/6623d/feature.webp 13w,\n/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/a4064/feature.webp 25w,\n/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/6ccb3/feature.webp 50w,\n/static/839274f7c5b34c547920d3226769854a/88d32/feature.webp 100w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 50px) 50px, 100vw"}]},"width":50,"height":33}}}}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interactive Graph Algorithm Learning Platform","slug":"floyd-visualizer","tags":["python","angular","graphs","network-visualizer","cytoscape","Angular Material","Educational Tool","Learning Tool"],"description":"Imagine a platform where complex graph algorithms come to life.
