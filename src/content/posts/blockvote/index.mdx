BlockVote is a revolutionary blockchain-based voting application designed to ensure fair and tamper-proof elections. Built with Angular and Truffle, this app allows users to create and manage voting campaigns, cast votes securely via Metamask, and view results with complete transparency on the blockchain. Every vote is recorded immutably, and results are available for public verification through Etherscan. With features like voiceover support for visually impaired users and multi-language options, BlockVote is designed for accessibility and inclusivity. Whether you're running a small election or a large-scale poll, BlockVote brings trust and efficiency to the voting process.

## Introduction

[![Block-Vote](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-BlockVote-blue.svg)](https://github.com/keshavlingala/BlockVote)

## Project Description

The application lets any user create campaigns, whoever creates the Campaign will be the Campaign's owner, and only he can
modify the Campaign. Each Campaign will have candidates. The Campaign owner can only add candidates.

In order to use the application, the user must install Metamask as a Blockchain wallet and connect to the respective network.
Users with voting rights can vote.

Moreover, the Campaign owner can make the Campaign Inactive. Everyone can see the votes and the Winner and Download the Results in PDF format. Each Campaign and candidate in the Campaign will have a unique blockchain address so It can be transparent, and all the vote transactions can be seen in transaction history and Etherscan.
Users can always go to the help screen to understand the rules and see FAQs for better usability.

The application is also accessible for visually impaired users using a voiceover when hovered over the screen.
The application also supports multiple languages with a single click of a button.
