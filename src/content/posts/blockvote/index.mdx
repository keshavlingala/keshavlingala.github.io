# BlockVote

Secure and Transparent Elections: Implementing a Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Introduction

[![Block-Vote](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-BlockVote-blue.svg)](https://github.com/keshavlingala/BlockVote)

## Project Description

The application lets any user create campaigns, whoever creates the Campaign will be the Campaign's owner, and only he can
modify the Campaign. Each Campaign will have candidates. The Campaign owner can only add candidates.

In order to use the application, the user must install Metamask as a Blockchain wallet and connect to the respective network.
Users with voting rights can vote.

Moreover, the Campaign owner can make the Campaign Inactive. Everyone can see the votes and the Winner and Download the Results in PDF format. Each Campaign and candidate in the Campaign will have a unique blockchain address so It can be transparent, and all the vote transactions can be seen in transaction history and Etherscan.
Users can always go to the help screen to understand the rules and see FAQs for better usability.

The application is also accessible for visually impaired users using a voiceover when hovered over the screen.
The application also supports multiple languages with a single click of a button.

## Technical Details

- Used Truffle to deploy smart contracts to Ganache and Sepolia Ethereum Network
- Used Angular 11 and NX Workspace for front-end development
- ng-web3 library to connect to Metamask and make blockchain transactions
- Used Google's Material Design Standard Components
